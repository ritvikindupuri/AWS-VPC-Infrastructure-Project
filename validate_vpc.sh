#This script automates the ping and curl tests you performed manually. 
#It uses the output from the CloudFormation stack to remotely connect to the public instance and run the validation commands. This demonstrates your ability to automate testing and verification.

# --- Configuration ---
# Replace with your EC2 Key Pair name (.pem file)
SSH_KEY="your-key-pair.pem"
# EC2 user for Amazon Linux
EC2_USER="ec2-user"

# --- Script Arguments ---
